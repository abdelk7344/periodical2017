                <span class="text-muted">Water Magical</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Water is like a genie who can change its form with supernatural powers incomprehensible to us mere humans. The only difference between water and a form-changing genie is that water is not supernatural. Water can change its form from solid
                to liquid to gas and vice-versa. <br> <br> As we all know, if you put water in a cup and put it in your freezer, it freezes—changing from liquid to solid. This is caused by the difference in temperature between the outside and inside your freezer.
                The freezing point of water is 0 ℃, so the temperature inside your freezer is below 0 celsius. Similarly, when you put water in a pot over an active stove, it boils—changing from liquid to gas. The boiling point of water is 100 celsius,
                so the temperature of the fire is over 100 ℃. These types of changes are called “phase changes”. But wait, human bodies are made of up to 75% water! Why don’t we turn into 75% of an ice cube or gas at these temperatures? You might think
                “obviously because we don’t have big enough ice cube trays”, but there’s more to it than that.</p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">What Happens to
                <span class="text-muted">Water Molecules?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The answer lies in the smallest amount of water possible—one molecule of water. We humans are made up of many different types of molecules that all change phases at different temperatures. But what happens in a phase change? Do the substances just decide to change their halloween costume? Actually, what phase a substance is in depends on how close their molecules are to each other. Think about magical floating crumbs from a cupcake you just ate and imagine that the crumbs are molecules while the cupcake is the entire substance. When the crumbs are very close to each other, the cupcake is a solid, when the crumbs are not too far apart, the cupcake is a liquid, and when the crumbs are very far apart, the cupcake is a gas. However, something special happens when water is frozen. Instead of the ice taking up less space, it takes up more space! How is this possible? <br><br> Water expands because of the arrangement of charges in a water molecule. Water is a big fan of Disney, so it arranges itself in the shape of a Mickey Mouse head. The ears are two positively charged hydrogens while the face is one negatively charged oxygen. Positive charges attract negative charges while negative charges repel other negative charges, so the ears of one water molecule like to stay near the bottom of the face of another. This causes the molecules to come together in shapes that resemble a hexagon instead of squeezing together, making them take up more space. <br><br> So water can be just like every other molecule, but it is the most special one. The celsius scale, which is one of the most widely used temperature scales in the world, is based on the boiling and freezing points of water. Without water, we could say goodbye to all those yummy icicle pops, and there would be one less Disney fan in the world.
