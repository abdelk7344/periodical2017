                <p class="lead">Iron(Fe) is one of the most common metal that we can find everywhere. However, the iron we see is not the pure iron. If a pure iron was placed in the air, it would oxidized to iron oxide (Fe2O3) because iron would react with water and
                    oxygen in the air. Therefore, as you see an iron product that is being rusted, you are actually watching the effect of water, or the reaction of water.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">In this case, we are focusing on the reaction between water and metals. As we discussed above, iron reacts with water and oxygen to form iron oxide. The reaction is so slow that we can not observe when it happens. However, not every metal
                    reacts slowly with water. When we look at the periodic table, the elements at the bottom lefthand corner will have the greatest reaction metal. When an active metal reacts with water an explosion will occur. For example, pure sodium
                    is more active than iron so when placing a small piece of sodium in water, it will burn out quickly and may jump out of the water. If the metal is big, the container will explode. However, water will oxidize the most active metals
                    so we will not see the explosive reaction between water and pure metals. But as mentioned above, water is not only a kind of liquid, it has various ways that can exist in nature. It can not only allow us to survive, but can also play
                    a dangerous role in our lives. How do you feel about water now?

                </h2>
                <p class="lead">Water will not only be dangerous in the laboratory, but also dangerous in nature. Rain and pure water are different types of water but have the same chemical formula, H2O. However, rain is more acidic than pure water and rain is a mixture
                    whereas pure water contains only one substance. How come rain is more acidic than pure water and how are they different? Well, as we measure a solution, we use a pH scale ranging from 0 to 14 to determine whether the solution is an
                    acid or a base. If the pH of a solution is lower than 7, it is considered an acid and a pH that is higher than 7 is considered a base. A more acidic solution will contain more hydrogen ions than hydroxides.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">So as we come back to the question, how come the rain is more acidic than pure water because rain has the pH of about 4.7 and water has the pH of 7? Acid rain is caused by a chemical reaction that begins when compounds like sulfur dioxide
                    and nitrogen oxides are released into the air from industrial plants. These substances can rise very high into the atmosphere, where they mix and react with water, oxygen, and other chemicals to form more acidic pollutants such as
                    the sulfuric acid, H2SO4. It is a common strong acid because it ionizes completely to hydrogen ions. Therefore, when those acids mix with water, the water will become more acidic.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">Because of the reaction between water and sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides in the air, the water becomes more dangerous. The ecological effects of acid rain are most clearly seen in aquatic environments, such as streams, lakes, and marshes
                    where it can be harmful to aquatic wildlife. Acid rain can also damage forests which leads to the environmental issues like sandstorms and global warming. Therefore, water can also bring disaster to us. Water is not always this pure,
                    healthy solution that everyone could rely on. Water is helpful in many ways yet, in some essence, it is also dangerous in some ways that we need to be aware of today.
