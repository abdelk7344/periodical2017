      </h2>
      <p class="lead">The most effective way to stay hydrated is to drink water (H2O). Good old H2O is critical for rehydrating when the body experiences fluid loss, such as sweating and going to the bathroom. Try to drink seven to 10 ounces of fluid every 10 to 20 minutes
        during exercise to stay properly hydrated. If you’re working out for longer than an hour or doing a particularly intense exercise (like running a marathon or participating in a tough training session), you will probably need to replace electrolytes
        too—this is where a sports drink or electrolyte-enhanced water comes in handy. Too much water can lead to hyponatremia, which is when excess water in our bodies dilutes the sodium content of our blood.</p>
      <p class="lead">When we sweat, we lose electrolytes, which are minerals found in the blood that help to regulate the amount of water in the body. Research suggests that sports drinks, such as Powerade and Gatorade, can help prolong exercise and rehydrate our bodies
        because they contain electrolytes which plain water does not. While an ordinary workout may not require electrolyte-replenishing, those participating in longer and more intense periods of exertion, such as running a marathon, will benefit from
        a good dose of electrolytes mid-workout. If you are someone who is not into sports drinks, or want a more natural alternative, water-enhancing electrolyte tablets, coconut water, or a homemade sports drink could be potentially effective substitutes.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">Many fruits are a great source of both electrolytes and fluids for our body as well. Bananas and dates are known for having high levels of the electrolyte potassium which makes them a great option for refueling during an intense workout (for example,
        a long run). To stay hydrated while keeping up with electrolytes, it’s important to drink water while munching on fruit (fruit does some water, but not as much as your water bottle). Some examples of fruits that are high in water level are watermelon
        and strawberries, which both contain 92% of water that can reduce the chance of dehydration. Grapefruit is also one of the most water rich fruits that has 91% of water. It's electrolytes are able to prevent dehydration. Some more examples are
        cantaloupe (90%), peaches (88%), pineapple (87%).

      </h2>
      <p class="lead">Another direct method to check if you are hydrated or not is is to weigh yourself. Hop on the scale before and after exercise. For each pound lost during activity, drink an additional 16 ounces of fluid. Losing a few pounds of body weight after
        exercise can put strain on the body and result in uncomfortable side effects like muscle cramps, dizziness, and fatigue. To prevent sweating away the water that keeps us hydrated, have a water bottle on the side.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">Lean muscle tissue contains more than 75 percent water, so when the body is short on H2O, muscles are more easily fatigued. When your muscles feel too tired to finish a workout, try drinking some water and resting for a bit before getting back at
        it.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">Go ahead, pinch yourself! Skin turgor, which is the skin’s ability to change shape and return to normal (or more simply put, it’s elasticity), is an easy way to check your hydration (though not 100 percent reliable for everyone). Using your pointer
        finger and thumb, simply pinch the skin on the back of your hand (not too hard!) and hold for a few seconds. When you let go, if the skin takes a while to return to its normal position, you may be dehydrated.
        <br><br>Therefore when it comes down to staying hydrated, you should never have an excuse in doing so. It's essential for the human body to properly function and keep the water level balanced. </p>
