      <p class="lead">
        Have you ever wondered why water is important? What happens if you don’t drink enough water? Did you know that water makes up about sixty percent of our body? Even though our body consists mostly of water, we still need water in order to function. Water
        plays a crucial role in a person’s body such as regulating and maintaining temperature and the organs. Since water is lost through breathing, exercising and urinating, individuals must remember to hydrate themselves. As a person gets older, they
        are prone to be dehydrated resulting to weaker interior organs and muscles. Their body becomes defective, such as a smaller body fluid and the inability to detect the lack of fluid in their body. By not being informed about their water intake,
        there will be serious consequences that follows. It is recommended that adults should consume about 8 cups of water everyday. Depending on their body mass, if they are active in sports or if they have health conditions, it may affect the amount
        of water they should consume.

        <br>
        <br> Chronic illnesses can play a factor in an individual’s health which can lead to dehydration. Those who have illnesses are probable to experience dehydration than the ones who don’t. According to the article on Mayo Clinic, dehydration factors
        can cause those who have diabetes to experience frequent thirst as to someone who does not have diabetes. Glucose would build up in the body, causing them to urinate more often resulting in a frequent loss of water. Since their body is not able
        to alleviate the excess glucose, it builds up in the body causing the bladder to draw in more water. Some symptoms of dehydration include…
        <ul class="lead">
          <li>Increase thirst</li>
          <li>Dry mouth</li>
          <li>Tiredness and sleepiness</li>
          <li> Dark color of urine</li>
          <li>Headache</li>
          <li>Dry skin</li>
          <li>Dizzniessn</li>
          <li>No tears when crying</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      </h2>
      <p class="lead"> In addition, diseases may arise if a diabetic person is dehydrated which can lead to heart and liver conditions. If they do not hydrate themselves, their blood would thicken, making them vulnerable to heart problems since the blood is not able to
        travel through the veins easily. It is important if a person is dehydrated that they immediately drink water or go to the doctor right away. This especially concerns those who are on medication and/or have illnesses that may affect their ability
        to prevent dehydration from worsening. Additionally, those who have kidney disease may experience dehydration often since their body does not get enough water which can lead to kidney stones and muscle damage. This produces pain in the kidney
        which is fatal when ignoring signs of dehydration.
        <br>
        <br> What happens if we go a day or two without water? How will our body react? Let’s say there is an adult female who exercises regularly and decides to not drink water to hydrate herself. It's a sunny day and she is sweating and not eating nor
        drinking at all. First off, she will begin to feel exhausted. She will be constantly thirsty and have joint pain from the lack of water to lubricate the bones. In addition, her skin may start to get dry and her energy will drain considerably.
        Then the worse symptoms may occur. She may begin to have low blood pressure which means the heart will beat and pump faster. It will be harder for the heart to pump blood. Severe diarrhea/vomiting will occur. By this point, the adult is in pain
        and may try to drink some fluids but since she is already in a stage where they experience the worst conditions, she may not be able to keep the fluids she drank in her body. This will eventually lead to seizures, hypovolemic shock, coma or death.
        What happens, if she begins to detect signs of dehydration before the worst symptoms? What happens if she decides to drink soda to quench her throat? Will that work? Although soda is a type of liquid, it is not a good idea to drink soda since
        it is loaded with sugar and other artificial ingredients. Soda will not be able to replace what water can do and can make a person even more thirsty. This is why it is important to drink water everyday and not be in a situation like this hypothetical
        scenario above. Conclusively, water is crucial to our health since it makes up about two-thirds of our body and our muscles depends on them in order to function.
