            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Early in history, people drank water from rivers, oceans, ponds, and bodies of water that contained unwanted compounds, debris, and bacteria from inorganic and organic materials which are often found in water when specific contaminants are
                not removed from the purifying process of H2O. In result, individuals contracted viruses, diseases, and infections that led to death and cancer. Today, corporations purify water for society to drink and function on. The necessary equipment
                for water purification is expensive and the process itself is difficult to execute. With simple and inexpensive materials, homeowners or campers can purify water with different methods. The most common and effective water purification
                is boiling. Boiling is the cheapest and safest method to purify water. The process can also kill germs and parasites and although not visible to naked eye, the effect of water boiling is super effective.

                            Pour the water into a vessel and turn on the fire to the highest setting.<br> When the water boils, you will see bubbles forming and fast movement of water.<br> Wait around 1-3 minutes in order to purify the water and give
                            it time to kill off the germs. (Remember: The more water you have, the longer it should boil, as there are more unwanted contaminants.) Considerations If the water is cloudy, then the water must be filtered before the boiling
                            process because you do not want to ingest the debris.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead"><b>Filtration</b> involves the separation of a mixture where small solid particles are in liquid or air. The water that is filtered is called the filtrate. Filtration is one of the most efficient ways to decontaminate water and make it safe
                for human consumption. The process eliminates both large and small compounds and dangerous contaminants that cause diseases. The other factor that makes filtration less costly is that it does not require a much energy and is an economic
                method as little water is lost during purification.Please take into consideration that this method doesnâ€™t removal all unwanted compounds, as the paper and/or cloth serves the purpose to only remove large impurities that are insoluble
                in water.
            </p>
            <p class="lead"><b>Settling</b> Another common separation process is called distillation. Distillation uses boiling to separate mixtures of liquid solutions. Take into account that different substances in the mixture will have different boiling points.
