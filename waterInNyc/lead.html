            <p class="lead">
                Many New Yorkers wonder about the water they are drinking -- whether it is tap, filtered, or bottled water. Although the American government constantly assures that the water we drink is completely safe, there are questions still left unanswered by New
                York’s civilians. The water we drink . . . .is it really as safe as it is perceived to be? You can decide for yourself.

                <br>
                <br> Recently, students in the United States received a letter from the government stating that there is a small percentage of the chemical, lead, in school water fountains. Although they state that the percentages are minimal at causing
                damage to the human body, many still question the rationality of that statement. The New York Post has shared a shocking article that opposes the claim of lead percentages being safe for students. According to Sellm Algar, he proposes
                the idea that the levels of lead found in water are actually extremely high compared to a safe amount of lead. The quantity of lead found in some schools exceed the safe amount of lead that is supposed to be in water. For example, “PS289
                in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, registered a 15,000 parts per billion lead level in December — 1,000 times the federal limit” (1). Many assume that this issue has risen due to the unsanitary conditions of the pipes that bring the water to
                our homes. Pipes are connected with solder (a low-melting alloy, especially one based on lead and tin used for joining less fusible metals) and these can include traces of lead. When the water in the pipes is contained for too long,the
                lead from the soldiers seeps into the water. This water then travels into our faucets and without knowing it, we would consume unsafe amounts of lead from our water. One way to test if there is lead in the water is to contact the water
                provider who will check if the water is safe to drink. Many also contact companies that will test a sample of the water to see if it is contaminated but these companies require you to pay for the test. One cannot check if the water has
                lead in it since lead is colorless, tasteless and odorless. This proves that there is a clear issue with the use of lead in our water. There are many reasons why one would be worried about the lead contained in the water. It is our job
                to protect our bodies and one way to do so is to drink water that is free of toxins like lead. There are many consequences to drinking lead as it can cause health disadvantages for the human body. According to Jacquelyn Cafasso, symptoms
                and signs of exposure to lead vary according to the age of the person and the amount of lead consumed. Some consequences for digesting lead can be fatal while others can be treatable.

                The rising factor of parents’ awareness of lead in water is very understandable due to the fact that it is a very serious concern if there is lead present in water. Many fear for their children due to the severe consequences of consuming lead in the water.
                Parents are concerned because they are still questioning the truthfulness of the idea that lead percentages are safe. According Mario Diaz, parents in Brooklyn are furious because they learned that Brooklyn schools have higher lead percentages
                than schools in Michigan. Parents are reaching out to reporters and demanding answers to their questions. Staci Ann Cooke-Richmond, a parent in Brooklyn, told a news reporter that "It's more questions than answers and nobody is answering
                us". This proves that parents are not keeping quiet anymore and are saying something because they do not want to expose their children to unhealthy drinking water.

                <br>
                <br> The health departments are making sure that parents feel safe with the water that their kids and themselves consume. According to the Department of Education (DOE) and the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), “the city
                regulates its own watershed that surrounds-- and protects--our reservoirs, and the water is tested over 50000 times each year at various points throughout the system” (1). To sum it all up, although many are concerned about the lead found
                in water, the New York State Department of Health is sure that the lead percentages are safe for the body.
