            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are about 8 million residents who live inside New York City, and that’s just the city. There are about a million other residents who live outside of New York City, yet do you ever wonder why New York is rated #1 in the United States that has the cleanest water? Well, first off, New Yorkers gets their water from the Catskill and the Delaware watersheds, located in upstate New York. Weather is a major factor in producing clean water due to turbidity. Turbidity, also known as cloudiness of water, happens due to heavy rains and harsh winds that can sweep minerals such as silt and clay into water, which is dangerous to consume. Forest health and water temperatures can also affect the water quality and the amount of water available.The Catskill and Delaware watersheds generates clean water, due to natural purification, which flows down to New York City. Natural purification is an automatic process. As it rains, the rainwater washes into the watersheds, which then gets naturally cleansed due to the soil and organic materials that lie within the beds of the ground. Water then flows straight into the Catskill Aqueduct, which runs 1,100 feet under New York City, which was created over a century ago. The water in New York may be clean, but is not drinkable yet. Chlorine is added in order to disinfect any other surviving bacteria. Some bacteria are immune to chlorine, which radiation is then used in order to get rid of any excess residue. Another reason why radiation is used is because chlorine is dangerous when there are organic compounds that still exists when cleaning the water. Most states that are not around the coast are unable to generate fresh and clean water due to it’s climate, especially states who live in the mid-west.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Keep in mind, the New York City drinking water supply system is the largest unfiltered water supply in the United States. It provides approximately 1.2 billion gallons of high quality drinking water to nearly one-half the population of New York State every day. An average resident in New York utilizes about 60-70 gallons of water each day. Each flush in New York is about 4.5-7.0 gallons of water. Also, each minute used in a shower uses about 1 gallon per minute. This is why New York must facilitate a large amount of water in order for residents to survive and to keep New York functioning. Next time when you think of water in New York, find out ways on how you could save water to better protect the environment.</p>
