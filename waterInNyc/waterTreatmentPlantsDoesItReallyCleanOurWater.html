            <p class="lead">Water treatment plants are known to clean our water. But does it really clean our water the right way? In the water treatment plants various methods are used to clean our water. Water that is brought to the water treatment plants is used for
                many things in our everyday life like drinking ,taking a shower, washing our hands,and flushing our toilets. The water that is being used goes through many processes to get clean enough to go back into the body of water that is closest
                to the plants like a river or a lake.The process that is used to clean the water helps the pH to make it safer to use and filtrates the water from the materials that are not healthy to the body of water that the water is returned too.
                The water goes through preliminary treatment, primary treatment, secondary treatment, and finally sludge treatment.</p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">The Digester <span class="text-muted">Egg</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">On our class trip to Newtown Creek water treatment plant we saw the process in action.We saw the tanks that the wastewater goes to for preliminary treatments and the huge digester eggs that are 16 stories high . The digester eggs were very
                big and when we got to the top we saw how the sludge was being cleaned. But before we went to the digester eggs we talked about the process and how it cleaned our water. The process starts with the preliminary steps. The water goes through
                the sewer that are under NYC to the plants and go through influent,which is a big grid that takes the big pieces of garbage, to protect the equipment during process. The next step is primary treatment where the water flow is slowed down
                which allows the heavy solids to go to the bottom and the light materials to float to the top. Once the process is complete, the light materials that are on the top are scraped off and the heavy solid, that is the sludge, goes into different
                tube to be separated from sand, grit, and gravel. The secondary treatment is when the wastewater and sludge is mixed with oxygen and the Aerobic bacteria eats the organic materials. Then the wastewater with the aerobic bacteria will move
                to the last settling tank so that the sludge will move to the bottom. The wastewater at this point is 94% clean and will be sent to disinfection where it stays for 15-20 minutes and is mixed with sodium hypochlorite to kill the leftover
                bacteria that was left through the process. However, the sludge that is there goes to the digester eggs that is at 98 degrees Fahrenheit, where the oxygen and bacteria break down sludge into water, carbon dioxide, and methane gas. <br><br>                Drinking water has a different system since it doesn't come from the water treatment plants, but from the Catskill, north and west of NYC, and goes down through the aqueducts. The aqueducts work mainly due to gravity that pulls the water
                down to the tunnels that leads to houses. There are 19 reservoirs and 3 lakes in a 1,972 square-mile watershed area.</p>
