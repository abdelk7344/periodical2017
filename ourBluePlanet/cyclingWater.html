            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Every living thing on Earth needs water to survive. Fortunately, Mother Nature’s got a pretty smart way of recycling water – the water cycle, it describes the existence and movement of water on, in, and above the Earth.The Earth’s water is
                always in movement and constantly changing states, from solid (ice) to liquid (water) to gas ( water vapor) and back again. But how do these changes happen? They happen through four main stages of the water cycle: evaporation, condensation,
                precipitation, and runoff.</p>
            <p class="lead">The water cycle has been around for billions of years and all life on Earth depends on it for them to continue to work. Water makes up 60 to 70 percent of all living matter and humans cannot live without drinking water for more than a week.
                In many cases, water structures the physical habitat of an ecosystem. Polar bears, for example, rely on ocean ice in order to successfully hunt and capture seals. Rivers, lakes, and other bodies of water divide environments into different
                habitats, effectively defining where some organisms can live and others cannot.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">What’s more, most of the life on Earth actually lives completely submerged in the waters of the oceans. The ocean plays a key role in this vital cycle of water, it holds 97% of the total water on the planet, which means that it is salt water
                and not drinkable, only about 3% of the water on the Earth is the water that we can drink; 78% of global precipitation occurs over the ocean, and it is the source of 86% of global evaporation. Besides affecting the amount of atmospheric
                water vapor and hence rainfall, evaporation from the sea surface is important in climate system because water evaporates from the surface of the ocean, mostly in warm, cloud-free subtropical seas. This cools the surface of the ocean, and
                the large amount of heat absorbed the ocean partially buffers the greenhouse effect from increasing carbon dioxide and other gases. The water cycle, or hydrologic cycle, distributes fresh water all over the earth's surface. </p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">What Makes up the
                <span class="text-muted">Water Cycle?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> <b>Evaporation</b> happens when heat from the sun turns liquid water into water vapor (gas).Evaporation usually occurs in the oceans because they cover so much of Earth’s surface. However, any liquid water that receives enough heat energy
                will evaporate to become water vapor.</p>
            <p class="lead"> Water vapor changes to water through the process of <b>condensation</b>, a process which changes water from a gas state to a liquid state. When water vapor in the atmosphere loses heat and cools down, condensation occurs. As the water vapor
                cools down and condenses, it attaches to small dust particles floating in the atmosphere, forming tiny liquid water droplets.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">The tiny liquid water droplets collide with each other forming larger drops. Eventually, the drops will become so heavy that they can no longer float in the air. Gravity pulls them down, and they fall to the ground as precipitation. <b>Precipitation</b>                is any form of water that falls to Earth from clouds. Precipitation can occur as liquid rain, or as solid (frozen) snow, sleet, or hail.</p>
            <p class="lead">Water in the atmosphere can either stay in the atmosphere or it can fall back to the Earth as precipitation. When precipitation hits the ground, it has two options depending on where it is in its story line. It may infiltrate the soil or continue
                across the land as runoff. <b>Surface runoff</b> is the water that flows over the land surface, and is a major component of the water cycle. Infiltration occurs when surface water enters the soil. At this point, the soil becomes saturated,
                but the excess water has to go to rivers or oceans. When this happens, we get an overflow in the form of runoff. And there’s a surprising fact about water in the Earth’s surface, it is that water stored in the Earth's surface can remain
                there for thousands of years before moving.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">And that is the water cycle, a process that keeps all the living organism alive.
