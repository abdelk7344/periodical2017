            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are many factors that could lead to the end of human life. One of those factors is water pollution. Water pollution is defined as contaminated bodies of water. Water pollution has a negative effect on the human body and there are many causes for that. There are many chemicals in the polluted water such as fluoride, lead, and heavy metals. <br><br> Fluoride is usually needed in the human body since it protects against dental caries and weakening bones. However, too much fluoride is harmful towards the body since it can cause an increase in lead absorption, thyroid disease, bone cancer, it can also increase tumor and cancer rate. Fluoride is not only dangerous for adults but, for infants since they are more easily affected by the fluoride. For infants, there are no benefits, the only thing that fluoride has towards infants are risks. The fluoride that the babies consume won’t help with their teeths unlike adults. Not only would fluoride have a negative effect on infants teeth but, as they grow up, their IQ level would be significantly lower than other children. However, there is fluoride water that’s sold for babies and it decreases the chance of getting dental fluorosis. Even though it lowers the rate of dental fluorosis, it’s recommended that babies should only start consuming  fluoride water when they start to get their teeth. The fluoride water that’s sold for babies is mixed with the infant formula and even with the fluoride water mixed with infant formula, there would still be an increased chance that infants will have dental fluorosis. Therefore infants should consume low-fluoride bottled water but, low-fluoride bottled water only lowers the rate of getting dental fluorosis and doesn’t eliminate it.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Water</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The water that we drink is contaminated with not only fluoride but, lead as well. Lead gets into our water through discharge from industries that burn fossil fuel, mine, smelt, and manufacture. When water is in leaded pipes for a few hours, lead can start to go into the water. The lead in the tap water is usually from the corrosion of older fixtures or from the solder that connects pipes. Lead doesn’t have any taste and it’s not able to be seen with the naked eye. This has negative effects towards humans. Towards adults, lead can cause a higher chance of catching the cold. For pregnant women, lead can cause the infant to have health problems and men would have a decrease in their sperm count. Lead is poisonous when it gets in the human body, it’s distributed just like regular metals in the human body. Once it gets into the bloodstream, red blood cells start to be destroyed. <br><br> Polluted water is dangerous for the human body. Polluted water contains both lead and fluoride. These contaminations have negative effects towards the human body. Without taking care of our water, our bodies will start to be easily infected by diseases. Water makes up most of the human body and without clean water, the human body won’t survive for long.</p>
