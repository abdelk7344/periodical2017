            <p class="lead" class="indent">Earth has been located in the Orion Arm, which is about two-thirds of the way from the center of our galaxy to the edge of the starlight, for approximately 4.543 billion years. The red planet Mars, also located in the Orion Arm, has been around
                for 4.503 billion years and has no resemblance to our planet. The difference in years that it has taken for the two planets to develop might be the significant factor in why Earth had the upperhand in becoming a “perfect” planet to be
                able to sustain life. For the planet to be able to do this, water had to play an important role . Mars did not have the same luck and the planet became a “dusty planet” but from recent research done by NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter
                has provided sufficient amount of evidence that the planet has liquid water flowing underground and preserved in Mars' soil. Mars’ soil has tons of nutrients like magnesium, sodium, potassium and chloride, all of which are necessary for
                living organisms to grow. For this to be able to occur, there would have to be water preserved underground. </p>
            <p class="lead" class="indent"> NASA researchers have theorized that Mars once had more water than Earth’s arctic ocean. This was determined by using ground-based observations, measuring water signatures in Mars' atmosphere. From the measurements of atmospheric water in
                the near-polar region, researchers determined the relative amounts of the two different types of water in the planet’s permanent ice caps. The development of the ice caps made it clear to NASA how much water Mars must have lost over-time.
                Scientists hypothesized that due to the absence of Mars’ magnetic field (it was weakened ), solarwinds first stripped Mars of its atmosphere causing all of its water to evaporate and vanish. The outcome of this was Mars having the dusty,
                sandy martian surface that it is known as today. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Earth and Mars</span>
            </h2>

            <p class="lead" class="indent">The volume of the polar caps is thought to have been approximately 6.5 times larger than the volume in the current polar caps, showing how much water drastically evaporated. This further concludes that the volume of Mars’ earliest ocean(s)
                must have been around 20 million cubic kilometers. Based on Mars surface today, a fit location for this water would be in the Northern Plains, considered a great place because of the low-lying ground. An ocean there would have covered
                at least 19 percent of the planet’s surface. By comparison, the Atlantic Ocean occupies around 17 percent of Earth’s surface. Michael Mumma, a Senior Scientist at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, expressed his thought into this, “With
                Mars losing that much water, the planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer”, Northon, Karen. "NASA Research Suggests Mars Once Had More Water
                Than Arctic Ocean." NASA. NASA, 20 Mar. 2015. Web. 21 May 2017. </p>
            <p class="lead" class="indent">Knowing more and more about Mars’ history will give us more insight on how the planet was not as successful as Earth in being able to habituate life and preserve its significant resource, water. Someday we will able to travel to the red planet
                and observe the martian water up close which will lead us to new discoveries. Until then, we will have to rely on what we know about water on Mars and expand more on Earth’s and Mars’ history.</p>
