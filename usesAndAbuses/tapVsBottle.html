                <p class="lead">It is mid August, New York is having one of the hottest days of the year and you are stuck at home with the air conditioner on. Your mouth is dry and it is begging for some ice cold water. You now have two choices, go to the fridge for
                    a bottle of water, or get a cup and fill it up with tap water and ice. But, you have one question in your head — which is healthier? Bottled and tap water both have their pros and cons, both affect the Earth and your body. Now everyone
                    put on your Sherlock Holmes hats and let's investigate and answer a huge question. Tap or bottle, which is healthier?</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">First, we will take a look at bottled water. Bottled water has many pros such as its convenience. You can purchase bottles everywhere and anytime. Bottled water is also known for its cleanliness. After natural disasters, water lines that may be affected and disrupted could lead to contamination of water supplied in every home. No one wants to drink dirty and colored water. Lastly, bottled water is very good because of its availability. Bottled water is available in supermarkets and stores in different shapes and sizes. But bottles do not treat Mother Nature properly. About 20 billion plastic water bottles wind up in landfills each year or are incinerated. Also, bottled water can cost hundreds or even sometimes thousands of times more than tap water. Lastly, bottled water can affect us as well. According to a test by the NRDC, about one-third of bottle water samples showed some contamination, which means it’s not pure or safer than tap water. As our investigation continues, we will see just how good tap water is compared to bottled water.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> Just like bottled water, tap water has its pros and cons. Some pros about tap water is that it's better for the environment. It doesn't pollute the land like bottled water where it creates landfills. Also, tap water is cheaper because drinking tap costs cents to the gallon even when you consider the cost of reusable water bottles. Now for its cons. Since 2004, more than 62 million Americans have been exposed to tap water that did not meet government health guidelines which is basically to check if water has any bad chemicals or bacteria which would harm the human body. The guidelines is also created to protect people from cancer and other diseases and many citizens have been unknowingly exposed for years. Also, because pollution and chemicals in tap water often have no scent or taste, many people who drink dangerous contaminants do not even realize they are doing so. We, as detectives, all see that both bottle water and tap water are helpful and harmful. But the question is, which one is the better choice?</p>

                </h2>
                <p class="lead">We are back in the kitchen, still deciding between tap and bottled water. Now that our investigation is over, which is the better choice? You can finally make your decision. You put the bottle back in the fridge and took a glass from the counter, filled it with ice, and put tap water inside. Conclusively, tap water is a much healthier choice since it is more environmental and contains less chemicals. Plastic bottles itself contain many deadly chemicals while tap water doesn't. Contaminants like benzene, mold, kerosene, tetrahydrofuran, fecal coliform and other bacteria, sanitizer, elevated choline, styrene, algae, and glass particles have all been found in bottled water. Benzene can affect your bones and reduce red blood cells. Mold can cause nasal stuffiness, throat irritation, coughing or wheezing, eye irritation, or, in some cases, skin irritation. Bottled water can cause a lot of damage to your body, meaning tap is the better way to go. After you finish your cup of victory, you smile in delight and say to yourself, “case closed”.</p>
