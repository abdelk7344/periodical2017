            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> It’s summertime and there you are walking around the streets of Kabul. The sun shining bright on your face and you begin to feel a thirst. Immediately, you begin searching for water. Remember you're no longer in the states. Where’s the water?
                Is there any water here? What’s the deal here? Well let’s begin to investigate. </p>
            <p class="lead"> Afghanistan climate is in crisis. As the temperature rises, the snow in the mountains start to melt. Unfortunately, Afghanistan has insufficient reservoirs and as a result doesn’t allow for runoff water to be stored. Less and less water is
                left to irrigate crops, and food production declines leaving farmers jobless. To further expand, Afghanistan is geographically disadvantaged. Afghanistan is primarily surrounded by other lands making it difficult to navigate routes to
                the Caspian Sea and the Arabian Sea. Now, add decades of war in Afghanistan which destroys most of your chances of having access to clean water. The water infrastructure in Afghanistan for the most has become a casualty of war.As a result,
                sanitation facilities don’t exist and because of this an estimated 20% of the population primarily practice open defecation. This practice is usually done in rivers which is the only source of water for some. A contaminated water source
                like this allows for diseases and infections to prosper. About 25% of deaths in Afghanistan are due to contaminated water and poor quality sanitation. For those who survive, such as children ranging from the ages of 6 months to 5 years
                experience stunted growth. While approximately 67% of Afghans weigh less than average. Due to not having a good source of water to drink from, many Afghans are prone to dehydration, kidney disease, and typhus fever. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Ready to make the trip? Remember first we have to check the water. Lucky for us the Green Cross Argentina, an environmental organization, has already carried out a research digging deeper into their water’s. Let’s see what they have to say.
                According to the head of GCA, Marisa Arienza concluded that there has been “substantial improvement” when it comes to having access to clean water, however the country still faces struggles. 11% of its population still relies on piped
                water experiencing “inequity of water access”. As a result, families begin drinking polluted water from wells. Having this as the only option creates “diseases and even disabilities” according to Arienza. However, the country does not
                remain still about the issue. The government in particularly the Argentina's president, Cristina Fernández, about every month makes an effort by inaugurating waterworks. This act allows piped water to be carried into populated areas mainly
                around Buenos Aires. Installed piped water and sewage systems help minimize the chances of a person getting sick from drinking water. Argentina main issues regarding water is having unequal access to water, pollution from agricultural
                chemicals, sewage and industrial effluents according to studies. Water use in Argentina is divided into 71% to agriculture, 9%livestock, 13% to household consumption, and 9% to industry. Before water is used it must be treated. In order
                to treat water, there must be large investments made. Consequently, poorer areas still do not have access to water. Water pipes set in place allows for groundwater to become polluted with effluents exposing water to pollutants and open-air
                garbage dumps. How about heading back to the states?

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Let's proceed with our investigation. As many of you know our selection of water is quite large. Why might that be? Are these water sources to be trusted? Well, let’s take a look and see. The United States is home to several lakes and rivers
                such as the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River. The country itself holds about 6 quadrillion gallons of water only from the Great Lakes. As for the Mississippi River, who flows at 4.5 million gallons per second, is responsible for supplying
                water to approximately 15 million people. These water sources are a great advantage for the country, because of this, people generally use 26.7% of water for toilets, 21.7% for washing clothes, 16.8% for bathing, 15.7% for the faucets,
                5.3% for other purposes, and 13.7% of water gets wasted primarily due to leaks. To regulate these water uses and minimize the levels of water that get wasted, the U.S established the Environmental Protection Agency to develop water systems,
                standards, and guidelines. Some of these works can be seen by how water systems are divided. For instance, public drinking systems are divided into: community and noncommunity. The community water system supplies water year round to the
                same population. Non-community water supplies water to parks, gas stations,etc.(know as transient) and factories, schools, etc. (known as nontransient) areas.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">Overall, as a nation, the US is fortunate enough to be geographically located near freshwater lakes and rivers and to have an established Environmental Protection Agency to ensure high quality water for all sorts of uses, however, the reality
                of the situation is that not everything is perfect. Currently, an estimated 40% of the world’s population is experiencing water shortage. The US wastes about 10,000 gallons of water per year. If we were able to use less water, we, as a
                country, would be able to supply and assist developing countries such as Afghanistan and Argentina. Afghanistan and Argentina are both countries with developing sanitation systems and are in constant efforts of improving their water systems.
                Argentina has made it more accessible to obtain water and Afghanistan consists of developing sanitation systems in cities but there is still more progress to be made. Water is an essential resource that should be available for every living
                individual.
