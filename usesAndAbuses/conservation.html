            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Water is by far possibly the most important necessity of human life. However the preservation and conservation of water has been depleting from humanity’s concerns. Statistics show that the consumption of water is actually more necessary than the consumption of food. To put a bigger perspective on how the lack and impurification of water can negatively impact a population, a person dies every 17 seconds due to dehydration and the consumption of unpurified water. Although this may not be happening all over the world, it certainly is becoming a reality for many. Additionally, the fact that fresh, clean water is a limited source is often disregarded by everyday people. This leads to many people not hesitating to chuck their trash directly on the floor or oceans. The main reason why we have fresh, clean water is solely due to the water treatment plants distributed across New York City, and other designated places across the states. However, despite the acknowledgment that the water treatment plants is a reliable system for purifying Earth’s water, the system requires a massive amount of energy. So, conserving water also conserves energy. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Conserving Water</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Imagine Earth as a planet whose population is depleting exponentially by weeks at a time. Surely the cause for such a devastation can vary, but the lack of water is certainly a possibility. Water has countless purposes and serves as a major factor for technological advancements. For instance, the expansion of implementing hypro-power into devices that require a non-renewable source of fuel. Without maintaining a reliable and clean source of water, these advancements would continue to remain as a mere concept. As the population increases, newer concepts for hydro-powered technology are created, but the usage of water has increased exponentially. Not to mention, the pollution of water increases significantly as well due to an increase of factories which leads to more sewage and wastewater being dumped into the ocean. As water pollution increases, the necessity and reliability of water treatment plants becomes more serious. Despite the fact that humanity already has a reliable system to purify polluted water, the systems requires a ridiculous amount of energy. In fact, in New York City alone, the Department of Environmental Protection is the 3rd highest energy user out of all the other departments in New York City. To put this in a larger perspective, if there was ever a situation where New York City’s energy supply were to suddenly cease. Millions of households, schools, business places would either completely lose water or only have access to unpurified water. Ultimately, I am simply trying to stress the idea that the conservation of water should be strictly considered, because, again, water is a major necessity for human life and without it-important cities, states, countries could crumble within days. The population is growing at an alarming rate. Lets help them survive. </p>
