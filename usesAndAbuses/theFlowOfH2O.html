            <p class="lead"> Agricultural water is what farmers utilizes to assist with the production of fruits and vegetables. This consists of the water from natural resources such as, rivers, streams, open canals, ponds, reservoirs, lakes and rain . Using any type
                of water is no problem, but how do they save and preserve it? Farmers not only let it rain on their crops, but they also collect the rain in barrels. Knowing that there are possibilities that farmers can run out of water, there are ways
                in which farmers can save water, by using techniques such as storing the water, growing more plants that don't need much water (depending on the climate), Top Dressing; using compost and/or mulch, since these materials absorbs water better
                and making it more difficult to evaporate.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">Another method is using drip irrigation, where pipe lines connected to a water source is lined up next to plants and crops. The water then is delivered slowly around or directly at the roots of the plants. Since the pipes are close, the pressure
                of the water isn’t as rough as sprinklers and doesn’t waste as much water as the sprinklers. This method of watering has become more and more popular because of how cost efficient it is, the amount of water it’s saving, and the lack of
                water spraying on bypassers if used in the public. </p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Organic is
                <span class="text-muted">better?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The last, surprising method that farmers could do, is to go organic. When farmers don’t use pesticides it actually keeps the soil more moisturized. This was proven in the 30-year farm system trial, when corn fields without pesticides sustained
                a drought rather than the ones with pesticides. During the realization of climate change and the effect it had on crops, companies like Dupont, Monsanto, and Syngenta went off to find out more ways to add and change the pesticides so that
                crop could be climate change resistant and would need less water. While this was happening the Rodale Institute's Farming System Trial had been observing the growth of organic crops, for thirty years. Instead of keeping the crops live
                and healthier pesticides had weaken them and made it more difficult to sustain to the climate change. Elaine Ingham a chief scientist says, “The current toxic-chemical approach to growing our food destroys the life of the soil with pesticides,
                herbicides, and highly inorganic fertilizers, they are destroying the support system, developed by nature over the last 4 billion years, that grow healthy plants”. Scientist have been trying to prolong the lives of crops and other plants,
                making it easier to grow and preventing them from dying in normal conditions (The all enough water, sunlight and where it’s grown rule). Now that all the pesticides and chemicals are failing because of climate change, they realize, plants
                don’t need all those chemicals to absorb the right amount of water, nature has done it all.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">The water that Farmers uses is very important and how they use it is just as important. Saving water can mean saving money and the plant itself. Who knew that even something as small as the way watering a plant could preserve so much money
                and effort. </p>
